# Omnicalc Forms

In this project, we'll practice writing forms and using the `params` hash to retrieve user inputs.

Visit [http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/results](http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/results) and make it work; first by simply typing query string parameters into the URL.

After that, help your users out a little by making a form for them at  [http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/new](http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/results) that will automatically compose the query string on the end of [http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/results](http://localhost:3000/loan_payment/results).
